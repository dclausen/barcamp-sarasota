1.  Added restful_authentication

2.  script/generate authenticated user sessions

3.  Deleted users_controller and app/views/user.  Assuming limited number of users, will create via script/console instead.

4.  Added "include AuthenticatedSystem" to controllers/application.rb

5.  Deleted public/index.html and added map.root to map to schedule controller

6.  For RESTful simplicity, added talks_controller and corresponding resource to routes.  Will only use new and edit views.

7.  Did same for rooms_controller

8.  Created layout/application.rhtml based on non-content html from views/schedule/index.html.erb.  Removed schedule.rhtml and moved
it's main contents into schedule/index.html.erb

9.  Added stylesheets/post-it.css from http://www.formassembly.com (sans images) to give better form layout and also added a few lines 
from Blueprint CSS to style notice and error messages to stylesheets/style2.css.  These could later be merged into style.css if accepted but wanted
to keep my changes separate for clarity.

10. Added some authentication routes: /login /logout

11. Added requirement for presence of room_id, start_time, end_time and basic validations for time
